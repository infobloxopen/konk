# etcd

[etcd](https://www.etcd.org/) is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and on standards-compliance.

## TL;DR

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/etcd
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [etcd](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-etcd) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This Helm chart has been tested on top of [Bitnami Kubernetes Production Runtime](https://kubeprod.io/) (BKPR). Deploy BKPR to get automated TLS certificates, logging and monitoring for your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 3.0-beta3+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/etcd
```

These commands deploy etcd on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Parameters

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the etcd chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
$ helm install my-release \
  --set auth.rbac.rootPassword=secretpassword bitnami/etcd
```

The above command sets the etcd `root` account password to `secretpassword`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
$ helm install my-release -f values.yaml bitnami/etcd
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Production configuration and horizontal scaling

This chart includes a `values-production.yaml` file where you can find some parameters oriented to production configuration in comparison to the regular `values.yaml`. You can use this file instead of the default one.

- Number of etcd nodes:
```diff
- statefulset.replicaCount: 1
+ statefulset.replicaCount: 3
```

- Switch to encrypt client communication using TLS certificates:
```diff
- auth.client.secureTransport: false
+ auth.client.secureTransport: true
```

- Switch to enable host authentication using TLS certificates:
```diff
- auth.client.enableAuthentication: false
+ auth.client.enableAuthentication: true
```

- Switch to encrypt peer communication using TLS certificates:
```diff
- auth.peer.secureTransport: false
+ auth.peer.secureTransport: true
```

- Switch to automatically create the TLS certificates:
```diff
- auth.peer.useAutoTLS: false
+ auth.peer.useAutoTLS: true
```

- Enable prometheus to access etcd metrics endpoint:
```diff
- metrics.enabled: false
+ metrics.enabled: true
```

To horizontally scale this chart once it has been deployed, you can upgrade the deployment using a new value for the `statefulset.replicaCount` parameter.

### Using custom configuration

In order to use custom configuration parameters, two options are available:

- Using environment variables: etcd allows setting environment variables that map to configuration settings. In order to set extra environment variables, use the `envVarsConfigMap` value to point to a ConfigMap (shown in the below example) that contains them. This ConfigMap can be created with the `-f /tmp/configurationEnvVars.yaml` flag. Then deploy the chart with the `envVarsConfigMap=etcd-env-vars` parameter:

```console
$ cat << EOF > /tmp/configurationEnvVars.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: etcd-env-vars
  namespace: default
data:
  ETCD_AUTO_COMPACTION_RETENTION: "0"
  ETCD_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: "150"
EOF
```

- Using a custom `etcd.conf.yml`: The etcd chart allows mounting a custom etcd.conf.yml file as ConfigMap (named, for example, etcd-conf) and deploy it using the `configFileConfigMap=etcd-conf` parameter.

### Enable security for etcd

#### Configure RBAC

In order to enable [Role-based access control for etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/op-guide/authentication.html) you can set the following parameters:

```console
auth.rbac.enabled=true
auth.rbac.rootPassword=YOUR-PASSWORD
```

The previous command will deploy etcd creating a `root` user with its associate `root` role with access to everything. The rest of users will use the `guest` role and won't have permissions to do anything.

#### Configure certificated for peer communication

In order to enable secure transport between peer nodes deploy the helm chart with these options:

```console
auth.peer.secureTransport=true
auth.peer.useAutoTLS=true
```

#### Configure certificates for client communication

In order to enable secure transport between client and server you have to create a secret containing the cert and key files and the CA used to sign those client certificates.

You can create that secret and deploy the helm chart with these options:

```console
auth.client.secureTransport=true
auth.client.enableAuthentication=true
auth.client.existingSecret=etcd-client-certs
```

### Disaster recovery

You can enable auto disaster recovery by periodically snapshotting the keyspace. If the cluster permanently loses more than (N-1)/2 members, it tries to recover the cluster from a previous snapshot. You can enable it using the following parameters:

```console
persistence.enabled=true
disasterRecovery.enabled=true
disasterRecovery.pvc.size=2Gi
disasterRecovery.pvc.storageClassName=nfs
```

> **Note**: Disaster recovery feature requires using volumes with ReadWriteMany access mode. For instance, you can use the stable/nfs-server-provisioner chart to provide NFS PVCs.

### Setting Pod's affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `affinity` parameter. Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

## Persistence

The [Bitnami etcd](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-etcd) image stores the etcd data at the `/bitnami/etcd` path of the container. Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across statefulsets.

By default, the chart mounts a [Persistent Volume](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) at this location. The volume is created using dynamic volume provisioning. See the [Parameters](#parameters) section to configure the PVC.

### Adjust permissions of persistent volume mountpoint

As the image run as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volume so that the container can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volume. However, this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions.
As an alternative, this chart supports using an initContainer to change the ownership of the volume before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this initContainer by setting `volumePermissions.enabled` to `true`.

## Upgrading

### 5.2.0

This version also introduces `bitnami/common`, a [library chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/#helm) as a dependency. More documentation about this new utility could be found [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common#bitnami-common-library-chart). Please, make sure that you have updated the chart dependencies before executing any upgrade.

### To 5.0.0

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

**What changes were introduced in this major version?**

- Previous versions of this Helm Chart use `apiVersion: v1` (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), this Helm Chart was updated to `apiVersion: v2` (installable by Helm 3 only). [Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) you can find more information about the `apiVersion` field.
- The different fields present in the *Chart.yaml* file has been ordered alphabetically in a homogeneous way for all the Bitnami Helm Charts

**Considerations when upgrading to this version**

- If you want to upgrade to this version from a previous one installed with Helm v3, you shouldn't face any issues
- If you want to upgrade to this version using Helm v2, this scenario is not supported as this version doesn't support Helm v2 anymore
- If you installed the previous version with Helm v2 and wants to upgrade to this version with Helm v3, please refer to the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/#migration-use-cases) about migrating from Helm v2 to v3

- https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/
- https://helm.sh/blog/migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3/

### To 4.4.14

In this release we addressed a vulnerability that showed the `ETCD_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable in the application logs. Users are advised to update immediately. More information in [this issue](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/1901).

### To 3.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. The following notables changes were included:

- **etcdctl** uses v3 API.
- Adds support for auto disaster recovery.
- Labels are adapted to follow the Helm charts best practices.

To upgrade from previous charts versions, create a snapshot of the keyspace and restore it in a new etcd cluster. Only v3 API data can be restored.
You can use the command below to upgrade your chart by starting a new cluster using an existing snapshot, available in an existing PVC, to initialize the members:

```console
$ helm install new-release bitnami/etcd \
  --set statefulset.replicaCount=3 \
  --set persistence.enabled=true \
  --set persistence.size=8Gi \
  --set startFromSnapshot.enabled=true \
  --set startFromSnapshot.existingClaim=my-claim \
  --set startFromSnapshot.snapshotFilename=my-snapshot.db
```

### To 1.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless you modify the labels used on the chart's deployments.
Use the workaround below to upgrade from versions previous to 1.0.0. The following example assumes that the release name is etcd:

```console
$ kubectl delete statefulset etcd --cascade=false
```
